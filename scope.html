            <p>The Coronavirus pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. Since its emergence late last
                year, the virus has spread to every continent. The majority of those infected with the virus will have
                mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and will recover without the need for medical attention. COVID-19
                may make anyone sick and cause them to get very ill or die at any age. The primary aim of this research
                is to bring a safe environment without COVID-19 and reduce the damage from the virus throughout.</p>
            <p>Today's world is moving forward with technology through industrialization. Various devices and software
                have already been created to minimize the damage caused by the covid 19 virus, which is a problem for
                human health. </p>
            <p>Currently, there is a trend in the society, even among ordinary people, rather than going to see a doctor
                for diagnosis, there is a tendency to use technology for diagnosis with the help of devices and software
            </p>
            <p>Although it is a problem to what extent this is successful according to the current social situation, the
                risk of disease can be prevented to some extent through these methods. If a person suffering from an
                epidemic virus such as covid-19 does not receive proper treatment, there is a high chance of dying.
                Because of this, even for an ordinary person, the diagnosis of such epidemics is difficult. If possible,
                it will be able to control disease as well as reduce loss of life.
                The primary goal of this project is to develop software based on mobile that uses technology to stop and
                minimize the harm caused by COVID19. Using the accurate data discovered, this software will be developed
                with a high level of precision.
            </p>
            <p>Even if the softwares that has already been created makes some contribution against the covid19 virus, it
                does not make a strong contribution to prevent the covid19 disease. If a patient infected with covid-19
                stays at home without understanding, The patient can make a firm judgment regarding his condition using
                this application, which is special due to the correctness of the information and the decision-making
                speed. Due to not maintaining proper social distance, the spread of this virus is slowly increasing.
                This software has a function that helps to maintain personal distance to prevent it and Giving him the
                necessary medical advice to minimize the harm that may occur and making the patient mentally stable
                through the AI system where there is an assistant who chat with the patient to make the patient calm.
                Also, it shows some medicines in order to reduce the covid risk. Application will also analyze the data
                of all the people who use the application and predict the spread of the virus like whether it is
                controlled or increased. Also, the user could analyze how far the next positive covid patient is and
                ensure the safety of user environment use of Google Map. This application can give all the resources
                necessary for an infected person to visit the hospital, as well as the information needed to obtain the
                COVID vaccine.</p>
            <p>As there is currently no application based on the Covid19 virus, This Application gives the populace
                excellent and effective service while minimizing the harm brought on by the covid19 disease.
                Covid 19 has turned into a global pandemic, putting several countries in a precarious predicament.
                Because of the changes in society, this predicament will have an impact on future generations. Due to a
                lack of competent medical aid and a rise in the number of patients, many individuals die in their homes
                and residencies. Even healthy people hesitate to help those who are infected since they are putting
                themselves in danger. As a result of these factors, the number of deaths caused by corona has increased
                dramatically. This method was created to assist corona virus patients. Health officials can use this
                approach to quickly identify persons who have the corona virus and reach out to them for medical
                treatment.
            </p>
            <p>This Application uses digital technology to retrieve accurate data and provide precise interpretations
                based on that data. The purpose of this research is to develop a Covid 19 Tracer that can identify and
                counteract Covid 19.

                After the completion of this study, it is hoped that the number of deaths caused by covid19 in Sri Lanka
                will be reduced, and that users suffering from this condition will be able to receive effective
                treatment and hospitalization. This mobile application is currently being developed to prevent against
                Covid 19 illness by taking all precautions available.
                The virus is transmitted from person to person. When an infected individual coughs or sneezes, tiny
                droplets of virus-containing fluid escape from the nose and mouth. Infection can occur if these droplets
                land on a surface and are then contacted by someone else who then touches his or her nose, mouth, or
                eyes. If a person directly inhales virus-containing droplets coughed or sneezed out by someone with
                COVID-19, the virus can infect them.
            </p>
            <p>When human Infect the Covid 19 Virus Sometimes symptoms aren’t show physically but the harm continues its
                way by spreading the virus to other people and the individuals will have to face the threat and
                aftereffects same as the infected people. Due to these factors people should have to do a checkup to
                predict covid 19 virus infected.</p>

                style="padding: 28px;font-weight: bold;color: rgb(7,7,7);">LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
            <p>According to the data found in the literature review, an
                application has already been developed to warn individuals
                and prevent the spread of the disease by using IOT, which
                contain cloud fag commuting sensors to identify the dengue
                disease. While observing that study and got an idea to develop
                a new product for the COVID-19 disease and created a mobile
                application that helps to work effectively in a limited time.
                In this article, the portable physiological checking framework
                will check the patient’s heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen
                level and blood pressure. However, those research components
                do not have the functionality to analyze both factors at the same time and make a forecast about the
                infection
                of COVID-19 using a Trained ML Algorithm. To predict
                infected suspects, the approach employs RMI images or chest
                X-ray data. The suggested method uses a Deep Learning
                model to detect infected lung X-Ray images. It is based on a
                modified Google Net pre-trained model. The Confusion Matrix
                and the ROC curve are used to assess the predicted accuracy.
                This type of research will aid in the detection of COVID-19
                infected individuals and the reduction of the disease, which is
                a threat to human life. Due to the length of time it takes to
                obtain a patient’s lung X-Ray, it is almost difficult to determine
                whether a patient has contracted COVID-19 in a short period
                of time. Governments have implemented a range of non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs),
                such as social distancing,
                in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.Although it has
                been demonstrated that observing social distancing principles
                in public settings can help prevent the virus from spreading,
                a contactless human distance measuring device with stereo
                vision has been demonstrated. A stereo camera is used to
                recognize people and quantify the distance between them in
                the created system. Several nations are in a grave situation
                as a result of the global pandemic that is COVID-19. This
                smartphone application is currently being developed to prevent
                the COVID-19 disease. After this research has been
                completed, the number of COVID-19 related deaths in Sri
                Lanka is anticipated to decline, and individuals who suffer
                from the condition are anticipated to have access to care and
                hospitalization.</p>
